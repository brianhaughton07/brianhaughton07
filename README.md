## About Me

I'm a data scientist and ML engineer with a foundation that most practitioners don't have: a master's degree in mathematics, many years of professional software engineering (C, C++, Java), and a consulting career spanning some of the most data-intensive industries in the world — finance, banking, credit cards, automotive quality engineering, manufacturing, and healthcare.

That path wasn't a detour. It means I can build models that actually make it to production, communicate findings to both engineers and executives, and understand the business context that makes the difference between an analysis that sits in a notebook and one that drives decisions.

I'm returning to my first love — data science and machine learning — with the engineering discipline to do it right.

## What I Bring

- **Mathematical depth** — M.S. in Mathematics; comfortable with the theory behind the methods, not just the API calls
- **Production engineering instincts** — 30 years writing systems-level and server-side code means I think about reliability, reproducibility, and maintainability by default
- **Business domain breadth** — hands-on experience across financial services, automotive manufacturing, and healthcare payer operations translates directly into feature engineering intuition and stakeholder communication
- **The bridge** — I've spent a career translating between technical teams and business leadership; I know how to frame a model's output in terms of decisions, not just metrics
