LICENSE DECISION RATIONALE
---

For a public portfolio repo, MIT is the right call. Here's why:

WHAT MIT GIVES YOU:
- Anyone can view, fork, use, and adapt your code
- Requires only that they retain your copyright notice
- Maximum visibility and permissiveness — signals confidence and openness
- Industry standard for portfolio and educational projects
- Employers can reference or use your code without legal friction, which
  removes a subconscious barrier to engagement

WHAT TO WATCH:
- If a project uses a dataset with its own license (e.g., CC BY-NC), your
  code can be MIT but note the data restriction clearly in the README
- If you ever use a GPL-licensed library as a core dependency and distribute
  a product (not just portfolio code), revisit — but for notebooks and
  scripts, MIT is clean

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED:
- Apache 2.0: Adds explicit patent grants; overkill for a portfolio
- GPL/AGPL: Copyleft — forces derivatives to stay open source; not
  appropriate here and creates friction for employers reviewing your work
- No license: Legally means no one can use or adapt it — the opposite
  of what a portfolio is for. Never leave a public repo unlicensed.

RECOMMENDATION: Use MIT. One LICENSE file at the root of each project repo.
You do NOT need a license on the profile README repo (username/username) —
that repo is purely presentational.
